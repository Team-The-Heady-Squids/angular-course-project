# Project

## Project Description

Design and implement a **Single-page web application** by your choice, using [Angular](https://angular.io/)

The application should have a:

### Public Part

The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**. This public part could be the application start page, application statistics, the user login and user registration forms.

### Private Part (Registered users area)

**Registered users** should have personal area in the web application accessible after **successful login**. This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality or the user's posts in a blog system.

>## Technical Requirements
>
>Your Web application should include the following:
>
>+ Create several **public dynamic web pages** and use them.
>+ Create several **private (authenticated) dynamic web pages** and use them.
>+ Create several **different pipes** and use them.
>- Create several **different directives** and use them.
>+ Create several **modules** and use them in the **routing**.
>+ All of the data should be loaded from a `web server` using **services**.
>  - You can either use `Firebase`, `Kinvey` or any other back-end service.
>  - Or you can use your own server written in `Node.js`, `ASP.NET WebAPI` or any other technology.
>- Unit test at **least 2 components**.
>- Integration test at **least 1 module**.
>+ Implement responsive UI using Bootstrap 3 or 4, or Materialize.
>+ Your project should pass the default TS linting configuration without any errors.
>+ You can use Angular CLI, Webpack, SystemJS or any other module loader/bundler.
>- Your application should compile, work and produce an adequate result.
>    - Applications that do not adhere to these requirements, will be severely penalized or not accepted at all.
>
>##  General Requirements
>
>+ Use Git
>  - Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or other online repository.
>  - Each team member must have meaningful commits with adequate commit messages.
>+ Brief **documentation** of the project and the project architecture
>  - As `README.md` file at the root of the github repository
>
>### Additional Requirements (Bonus points and real world skills)
>
>- Use `git flow` or other **branching** workflow.
>- Build your application using an **agile project managment tool/system**
>    - Simple ones are Trello, ZenHub, GitHub Issues
>    - More advanced ones are Jira, MS Team Services
