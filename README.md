Simple forum single page application, built with Angular 4 for Telerik Academy's "Web apps with Angular" course

# Getting started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Project

## Project Description
```
Design and implement a **Single-page web application** by your choice, using [Angular](https://angular.io/)

The application should have a:
```
### Public Part
```
The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**. This public part could be the application start page, application statistics, the user login and user registration forms.
```
### Private Part (Registered users area)
```
**Registered users** should have personal area in the web application accessible after **successful login**. This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality or the user's posts in a blog system.
```
## Technical Requirements
```
Your Web application should include the following:

+ Create several **public dynamic web pages** and use them.
+ Create several **private (authenticated) dynamic web pages** and use them.
+ Create several **different pipes** and use them.
- Create several **different directives** and use them.
+ Create several **modules** and use them in the **routing**.
+ All of the data should be loaded from a `web server` using **services**.
  - You can either use `Firebase`, `Kinvey` or any other back-end service.
  - Or you can use your own server written in `Node.js`, `ASP.NET WebAPI` or any other technology.
- Unit test at **least 2 components**.
- Integration test at **least 1 module**.
+ Implement responsive UI using Bootstrap 3 or 4, or Materialize.
+ Your project should pass the default TS linting configuration without any errors.
+ You can use Angular CLI, Webpack, SystemJS or any other module loader/bundler.
- Your application should compile, work and produce an adequate result.
    - Applications that do not adhere to these requirements, will be severely penalized or not accepted at all.
```
##  General Requirements
```
+ Use Git
  - Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or other online repository.
  - Each team member must have meaningful commits with adequate commit messages.
+ Brief **documentation** of the project and the project architecture
  - As `README.md` file at the root of the github repository
```
### Additional Requirements (Bonus points and real world skills)
```
- Use `git flow` or other **branching** workflow.
- Build your application using an **agile project managment tool/system**
    - Simple ones are Trello, ZenHub, GitHub Issues
    - More advanced ones are Jira, MS Team Services
- Upload your application in the cloud
  - MS Azure, HerokuCloud, Amazon, all are fine
- Consume moderate quantities of pizza and bira.
